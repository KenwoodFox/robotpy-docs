Hardware & Sensors
==================

FIRST has put together a lot of great documentation that can tell you how to
connect hardware devices and interact with it from robot code.

* :doc:`Hardware APIs <frc:docs/software/hardware-apis/index>`
* :doc:`Using CAN Devices <frc:docs/software/can-devices/index>`
* :doc:`WPILib Sensors <frc:docs/software/hardware-apis/sensors/index>`
* :doc:`Driver Station Inputs and Feedback <frc:docs/software/driverstation/index>`

While their documentation code samples are in C++ and Java, it's fairly
straightforward to translate them to python -- RobotPy includes support for all
components that are supported by WPILib's Java implementation, and generally
the objects have the same name and method names.

If you have problems translating their code samples into Python, you can
use our support resources to get help (see :ref:`Support`).
