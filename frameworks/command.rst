Command Framework
=================

If you're coming from C++ or Java, you are probably familiar with the Command based robot paradigm. All of the pieces you're used to are still available in RobotPy.

.. note:: Unfortunately, nobody has written any Python specific documentation for
          the new command framework. Please refer to the :doc:`WPILib documentation<frc:docs/software/commandbased/index>` for now.

          If you're interested in contributing a Python-specific guide to 
          the command framework, we'd love your help!
