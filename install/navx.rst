====================

Setup (tests/simulator)
-----------------------

If you intend to use robotpy-navx in your *robot tests* or via the *pyfrc
simulator*, you must install this package locally::

    pip3 install -U robotpy-navx

Or on Windows::
    
    py -3 -m pip install -U robotpy-navx

Then, when connected to the roborio's network, run::

  py -3 -m robotpy_installer install-opkg robotpy-navx
