Getting Started
===============

RobotPy WPILib is a set of libraries that are used on your roboRIO to
enable you to use Python as your main programming language for FIRST Robotics
robot development. It includes support for almost all components that are
supported by WPILib's C++ implementation.

.. note:: Work on 2020 RobotPy is ongoing, but we're hoping to support all 
          WPILib C++ features by the end of the season!

          See the :ref:`2020 Notes <2020_notes>` for important information about 
          RobotPy in 2020.

You can run RobotPy-based programs either on your computer or on a robot. There
are a lot of different ways you can get started with RobotPy, but we recommend
the following steps:

* :ref:`Install the Robot Simulator and related tools <install_pyfrc>`
* Learn how to write Python-based robot code via :ref:`anatomy` and the various
  sections of the :ref:`programmer's guide <programmers_guide>`

Once you've played around with some code in simulation, then you should 
:ref:`install RobotPy on your robot <install_robotpy>`.

If you're looking to use pynetworktables on the driver station or on a
coprocessor, then check out the :ref:`pynetworktables install docs <install_pynetworktables>`.
